It contains instructions on how to structure each module, how to facilitate each activity, and specific information on the content of the programme.\nIt also offers a range of practical tools to support session delivery and parent group management. Facilitators can access pre-drafted messages and pre-recorded audios and videos to share with parent groups, manage multiple groups at once, add and update parent information, track attendance, and generate and share session reports with ease. \nIt is very important that you try your best to follow all of the activities and instructions in the app sessions. However, please remember that the app sessions are only a guide to support you after participating in a training workshop by a certified PLH trainer.\n\n**The extent to which @global.prog_name can change how parents behave towards their children is entirely up to YOU.** \nWe like to say that **WHAT** you deliver – that is the content of the @global.app_name – is only 20% of the programme. \n\n**80% of the programme is HOW you deliver the programme.** Your behaviour towards the parents and the way you facilitate the programme is the most important part.  \n\nWhen you deliver the programme, you need to model the collaborative approach to problem solving to bring about the change we want to see in parents and the community. \n\nModelling includes understanding stages of child development, praising and encouraging parents, using active listening skills, being consistent and compassionate, exploring problems, and practicing solutions.\n\nRemember that if there is anything that you cannot remember or feel unsure of, practice it with another facilitator or ask your supervisor/coach. \n\nJust as we say to the parents, “It is what you do at home that makes the difference,” the same thing applies to you. \n\nWhen you practice facilitation skills before a module, you will be more confident and able to deliver the programme for parents.\n\nIt is also important that you practice the skills from the programme with your own children and teens at home (if you have any). You may also find that many of the skills are applicable and helpful in creating positive relationships with others, such as your colleagues, friends, and loved ones!  \n\nThank you for your commitment and dedication to reducing violence against children and promoting child wellbeing through positive parenting.
