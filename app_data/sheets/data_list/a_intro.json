Write down any notes or reminders that might be helpful for particular activities. Sometimes, the participants will not initially understand what you are asking them if you say the exact words in the manual. It can be helpful to write different ways of asking the discussion questions.\n \nIf you don‚Äôt understand something or forget how to do an activity, ask! You can also message or call another facilitator or your supervisor prior to the module. Look through your participant profiles to review each person‚Äôs progress in the programme and to remember any special needs or concerns. This is particularly important for the goals that participants set themselves at the end of the session and the discussion on home activities. Start preparing before the next module. You want to be relaxed and ready to go!\n\nRemember that this app is just a guide. While it is very important that you deliver the programme content as it was designed, it is also important that you find ways to make it your own."

Pause**. \nBefore you say anything, slowly breathe in and out. It will calm you and give you a chance to think.\n\n**SHARE how you feel**\nThis is hard. Many of us were told not to cry or show our feelings to our children. But take a deep breath and calmly tell them how you feel. They will understand better, and also learn from you how to deal with stress. \n\n**LISTEN to your child or teen**\nAllow your child to share their emotions. You can also reflect back what they say to you. Accept that the feeling is okay, even if it is negative.\n\n**SHOW them you care**\nThis is also hard! Stress makes us focus on ourselves. But our children and teens need our support. Ask them how they feel. Listen to them and comfort them. Try a hug or say, ‚ÄòI understand.‚Äô It can change everything.\n\n**SEEK the positive**\nCan you and your child or teen think about ideas that might help? Can you do something positive together to take your mind off the stress?"

Parents can use planned consequences with their children and teens when they forget or do not follow household rules.
