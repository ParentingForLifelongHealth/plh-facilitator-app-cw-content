      "text_2": "The key building blocks for Talking about Emotions are Breathe, Share, Listen, Show, and Seek:\n\nBREATHE. Slowly. Pause. \nBefore you say anything, slowly breathe in and out. It will calm you and give you a chance to think.\n\nSHARE how you feel\nThis is hard. Many of us were told not to cry or show our feelings to our children. But take a deep breath and calmly tell them how you feel. They will understand better, and also learn from you how to deal with stress. \n\nLISTEN to your child or teen\nAllow your child to share their emotions. You can also reflect back what they say to you. Accept that the feeling is okay, even if it is negative.\n\nSHOW them you care\nThis is also hard! Stress makes us focus on ourselves. But our children and teens need our support. Ask them how they feel. Listen to them and comfort them. Try a hug or say, ‘I understand.’ It can change everything.\n\nSEEK the positive\nCan you and your child or teen think about ideas that might help? Can you do something positive together to take your mind off the stress?"

They do this in two ways: \n\n1️⃣Giving specific, positive, and realistic instructions\n2️⃣Praising their children for following instructions and at other times\n\nWhen parents give specific, positive, and realistic instructions, children know exactly what behaviour is expected from them. \n\nFor example, “Please put your toys away in the box.” This tells the child exactly what to do by describing the behaviour that is expected. It also considers the capabilities of the child so that the instruction is realistic. \n\nCompare this to, “Don’t make a mess,” which does not describe the behaviour that a parent would want to see, is not specific, and might not be realistic if the child is not capable of keeping tidy. \n\nChildren also have challenges following many instructions at one time – especially younger children. They are much better at following instructions if they are given one at a time.  Parents can pause for a bit to give children time to follow each instruction before moving to the next one. It may take more time, but this supports children to follow instructions and to remember the task.  \n\nEach child has their own unique characteristics and capabilities. It is important that parents know what is realistic for their children to do when giving them instructions. For instance, it is very hard for children to keep quiet for a whole day but maybe they can keep quiet for 15 minutes while their parents take a call.  \n\nChildren also hear better and understand the instructions clearly when parents speak in a calm voice. Yelling at children only increases the tension for everyone. Children are also more likely to follow instructions in a calm way.\n\nPraise is an expression of approval or appreciation. When parents praise their children for following instructions, they are encouraging that behaviour to happen more often. The same works for praising other behaviours. Also, behaviour that is ignored is less likely to happen again. \n\nWith the example above, a parent could say, “Thank you for putting your toys in the box, Joseph,” after he follows the instruction. This will encourage Joseph to continue cleaning up his toys in the future. It also maintains a positive feeling between the parent and Joseph."
